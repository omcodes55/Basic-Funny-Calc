# Basic-Funny-Calc
ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: Funny Simple Calc! ðŸŽ‰

As part of my journey in Java Enterprise Development, I recently developed a fun and interactive web application called Funny Calc. This project was built using Java Enterprise Programming within Eclipse IDE, incorporating HTML, Servlets, and JSP to create a smooth and engaging user experience.

It was an exciting experience working on this project, allowing me to apply my skills in web development and enterprise Java technologies. Can't wait to explore even more challenging projects ahead!
